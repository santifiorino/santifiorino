      Around two years ago I built my first personal portfolio. Looking back at
      it this year, I thought "it looks good, but it doesn't represent me very
      well", which is the main goal. After some research I decided to build this
      website inspired by Mondrian's work, and mix it with some 80's graphic
      elements. I think this colorful design is more alive, and fits my style
      better. If you're a developer, you know it's also a harder style to
      achieve, so it really shows what I'm capable of, which is the other main
      goal.

      I try to get as close as possible to the "Designer" concept by using
      theory to solve problems and find solutions that are as functional as
      possible, but also using creativity to come up with new things, and keep
      everything neat and elegant. What does that have to do with this website?
      Designers usually show their work by making a portfolio, and that's
      essentially what this website is.

      I'm constantly starting new projects, so I wanted to make a place where I
      can exhibit all of them and my career. I learn new things from each
      project, and not only about new technologies and computer science. Each
      project also gives me knowledge of the topic it's focused on– for example,
      my inflation project taught me a lot about economics. That's what pushes
      me forward to make more projects– in whichever aspect I look at it, it’s a
      win for me. I thought it would also work as an interactive CV, which I can
      use when applying to jobs.
