      Around two years ago I built my first personal portfolio. This year
      looking at it I thought "it looks good, but it doesn't represent me very
      well" which is the main goal. After some research I decided to build this
      website inspired on Mondrian's work, and mixing it with some 80's graphic
      elements. I think this colorful design is more alive, and it fits my
      style. If you're a developer you know it's also a harder style to achieve,
      so it really shows what I'm capable of, the other main goal.

      I try to get as close as possible to the "Designer" concept by using
      theory to solve problems and find solutions that are as functional as
      possible, but also using creativity to come up with new things, and keep
      everything neat and elegant. Â¿What does that have to do with this website?
      Designers usually show their work by making a portfolio, and that's
      essentially what this website is.

      I'm constantly starting new projects, so I wanted to make a place where I
      can exhibit all of them and my career. I learn new things from each
      project, and not only new technologies and computer science stuff. Each
      project also gives me knowledge of the topic its focused on, for example
      my inflation project taught me a lot about economy. That's what pushes me
      forward to make more projects, it's a win in every aspect I can look at. I
      thought it would also work as some kind of interactive CV, which I can
      show when I apply to a job, so I don't just say "I can do this or that",
      but I show this instead.
