      Argentina has a terrible inflation problem– one of the highest inflation
      rates in the world. This website lets you pick a country and then creates
      a simulated store where the prices are the ones Argentina would have if
      its inflation rates in the last 20 years were the same as that country.
      This project is not politically biased in any way– it shows real world
      data, such as a regular graph. This is my first project that got news
      coverage, both on TV and newspapers.

    Once you get to the simulated store with the fake prices, under each product
    there is a button which lets you see what the real price of the product is,
    and it's never good news. To get the “fake price”, I did some research on
    the prices of some products in Argentina in 2002. Then I looked up some
    other countries’ cumulative inflations in the past 20 years, and if you add
    that percentage to the 2002 price, you get how much they would cost today
    with their inflation. Finally, I got a list with the current price of all
    the products, and that’s all of the information I needed for the website.

    The day after making the website public, two news reporters contacted me
    asking for permission to show it on TV, and asking about how I created it
    and which sources I used. That same day, it got featured on two of the most
    popular Argentinian TV channels, and three articles were written about it.
