      Argentina has a terrible inflation problem. One of the highest inflation
      rates in the world. This website lets you pick a country and then creates
      a simulated store where the prices are the ones Argentina would have if
      its inflation rates in the last 20 years were the same as that country.
      This project is not politically biased in any way, it shows real world
      data, shuch as a regular graph. This is my first project that got news
      coverage, both on TV and newspapers.

    Once you get the simulated store with the fake prices, under each product
    there is a button which lets you see what's the real price of the product,
    and it's never good news to see it. To get the “fake price” I did some
    research on the prices of some products in Argentina in 2002. Then I looked
    up some other countries’ cumulative inflation in the past 20 years, and if
    you add that percentage to the 2002 price, you get how much they would cost
    today with their inflation. Finally I got a list with the current price of
    all the products, and that’s all of the information I needed for my website.

    The day after making the website public, two news reporters contacted me
    asking for permission to show the website on TV, and asking about the
    creation process of it and my sources. That same day it got featured on two
    of the most popular Argentinian TV channels, and got three articles written.
